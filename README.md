## Implementation Details

In this project, the Parallax effect was implemented using HTML and CSS. Here's an overview of how it was achieved:

1. **HTML Structure**: The website layout was built using HTML elements, such as `div`, `section`, and `header`, to create the required sections and structure of the page.

2. **CSS Styling**: CSS was used to style the website elements, including colors, sizes, fonts, and positions. Media queries were applied to ensure a responsive design across different screen sizes.

3. **Parallax Effect**: The Parallax effect was achieved using CSS techniques, such as `background-attachment: fixed` and `transform: translateZ`, combined with appropriate positioning and scrolling behavior. These techniques create the illusion of depth and movement as the user scrolls through the page.

4. **Content and Assets**: Replace this section with information about the specific content and assets you used in your Parallax website. For example, if you included images, videos, or other media, describe how they were incorporated into the design.
